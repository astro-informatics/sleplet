  "description": "SLEPLET is a Python package for the construction of Slepian wavelets in the spherical and manifold (via meshes) settings. The API of SLEPLET has been designed in an object-orientated manner and is easily extendable. Upon installation, SLEPLET comes with two command line interfaces — sphere and mesh — which allows one to easily generate plots on the sphere and a set of meshes using plotly.",
